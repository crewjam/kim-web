About Me

I am an Assistant Professor of Urban and Regional Planning at the University of Michigan. My research explores the cultural, economic, and political aspects of urban space. I earned a masters degree in geography from the University of Oxford and a PhD in geography from the University of California, Berkeley. I then received a three-year fellowship with the Society of Fellows at the University of Michigan, and subsequently joined Michiganâ€™s Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning. I am the author of DIY Detroit: Making Do in a City without Services (University of Minnesota Press, 2016) and The Politics of Urban Water: Changing Waterscapes in Amsterdam (University of Georgia Press, 2015).
