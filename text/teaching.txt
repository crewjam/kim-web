Teaching

I teach courses on urban theory and urban place-making. My curriculum highlights the messy interconnections that suture physical forms and social processes together. In my classroom, alongside canonical city planning texts, I teach literature from sociology, anthropology, history, and geography, and I expose students to a wide range of case studies from domestic and international contexts. This comparative, interdisciplinary approach encourages students to evaluate planning techniques from many perspectives, in many contexts, and with many possible metrics of success. I also encourage students to hone their critical reading, writing, and communication skills. Students in my classes routinely prepare written responses to course readings and then use class time presenting ideas to peers, asking probing questions, and engaging in group debates. These techniques, which prioritize the development of critical thinking abilities alongside city planning skills, help students gain a broad understanding of the direct and indirect political, economic, and cultural implications of their professional work.
